quickhull_3_demo
----------------

This demo program illustrates the 3D version of the quickhull algorithm.
The user supplies a non-negative integer value indicating the number 
of points to be generated.  The points are drawn randomly from a sphere
of a certain radius and the resulting hull of the points is displayed 
in a Geomview window.  

incremental_3_demo
------------------

This demo program illustrates the 3D specialization of the d-dimensional
incremental construction data structure.  250 points are drawn randomly 
from a sphere of a certain radius and are inserted one by one into the 
convex hull.  Then the resulting polyhedron is created and the result 
is displayed in a Geomview window. 

For both programs, to get the hull centered in the geomview window, you 
should use the "Look" button in the Geomview controls.

To compile both programs, you may use the provided makefile.

------- simple_example --------------------------------------------------------

This example shows the incremental construction of a 3D Delaunay triangulation,
the location of a point, and how perform elementary operations on indices in a
cell. It uses the default parameter of the Periodic_3_Delaunay_triangulation_3
class for the triangulation data structure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------- colored_vertices ------------------------------------------------------

If the user does not need to add a type in a vertex that depends on the
TriangulationDataStructure_3 (e.g. a Vertex_handle or Cell_handle), then he can
use the Triangulation_vertex_base_with_info_3 class to add his own information
easily in the vertices. This example shows how to add a CGAL::Color this way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------- adding_handles --------------------------------------------------------

If the user needs to add a type in a vertex that depends on the
TriangulationDataStructure_3 (e.g. a Vertex_handle or Cell_handle), then he has
to derive his own vertex base class, as this example shows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------- covering --------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we construct a triangulation that can be converted to the
1-sheeted covering. However, we can insert new points such that the point set
does not have a Delaunay triangulation in the 1-sheeted covering anymore, so
the triangulation is not extensible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------- large_point_set -------------------------------------------------------

For large point sets there are two optimizations available. This example
demonstrates how to use them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------- geometric_access ------------------------------------------------------

There are geometric iterators to have access to the geometric primitives
without the combinatorial information. This is especially useful in case the
point set does not have a triangulation in the 1-sheeted covering but the user
does not want to deal with periodic copies of geometric primitives. This
example demonstrates how to use the geometric access functions.
